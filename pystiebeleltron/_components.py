class ControllerComponents:
    """The components of one controller, refreshed in one poll.

    Stiebel documents register blocks that not every controller and firmware
    actually serves - the energy-management extension, the inverter and
    efficiency figures - and no register says which of them a given machine has.
    A controller answers a read of a block it does not implement with a Modbus
    exception (illegal data address), and one such block fails an entire pooled
    read, so a machine without an optional block could not be read at all.

    Hence the split: the components every controller serves are pooled into one
    set of block reads and still fail the poll when they fail, because then
    something is genuinely wrong. An optional component is read on its own, and
    the first time the controller refuses it, it is dropped for the life of this
    object, so no later poll wastes a round trip on it.

    A machine that does not have the block refuses it on the very first read,
    before any value was stored, so its fields read ``None`` from then on, the
    same as a value the controller reports as unavailable. A block that answered
    once and is refused later - a module switched off, new firmware, a different
    device on that address - keeps the values of its last successful read
    instead, until the object is rebuilt. Clearing them would take a public way
    to invalidate a ``Component``'s cache, which ``modbus_connection`` does not
    expose.

    An optional component costs one extra read per poll while the controller
    does serve it. That is the price of being able to tell "this machine does
    not have it" from "this read failed", which the protocol itself does not
    distinguish.
